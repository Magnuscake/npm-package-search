# npm package search using Redux and Typescript

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This a simple bare-bones application that uses an API to search npm for a package and displays the first few package items.

This project was more of a practice app as I delve deeper into the typescript ecosystem.
